A graph G = (V,E) consists of a nonempty set V of Vertices or Nodes and a set of E of Edges. Each Edge has either one or two vertices associated with it, called its endpoints. An edge is said to connect its endpoints.
# Applications  of Graphs
We will illustrate how graph theory can be used to model:
- Social networks
- Communication networks
- information networks
- software design
- Transportation networks
- Biological Networks

It's a challenge to find a subject to which graph theory has not yet been applied.
