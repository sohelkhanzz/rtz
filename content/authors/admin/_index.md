Hi! I'm Sohel Khan. I am an online tech writer and certified google ads specialist. As a google ads expert, I help businesses generate  more traffic and leads.There is no question of good luck and "hope marketing". I simply switch  off the ads that don't work and double down on the campaigns that do work! 
I help  businesses and organizations establish and grow their digital presence. 95% of people who may be mot interested in your service. With modern Ad techniques, I can completely exclude these people and only focus on your target group with specific targetinging! As a result, you will pay less and have better results!
I can help you setup a new Google Ads account, a review or audit an existing Ads account, optimise on an ongoing  basis.
